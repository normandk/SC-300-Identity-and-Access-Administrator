# Lab 15 - Implement and test a conditional access policy

## Lab scenario

Your organization needs to be able to limit user access to its internal applications. You must deploy an Azure Active Directory conditional access policy.

#### Estimated time: 10 minutes

## Create a conditional access policy

Azure Active Directory conditional access is an advanced feature of Azure AD that allows you to specify detailed policies that control who can access your resources. Using Conditional Access, you can protect your applications by limiting users' access based on things like groups, device type, location, and role.

1. On the Azure Active Directory blade, under **Manage**, select **Security**.

1. On the Security blade, in the left navigation, select **Conditional access**.

1. On the top menu, select **New policy**.
